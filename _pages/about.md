I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer System Labtorary](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Mohamed S. Abdelfattah](https://www.mohsaied.com/). My research interests broadly encompass building machine learning systems and designing efficient algorithms for accelerating AI and ML applications. Before joining Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, where I worked with Prof. Kai-Chiang Wu. 

During my senior year, I was fortunate to gain research experience as a remote intern under the guidance of Prof. Luis Ceze at the University of Washington, mentored by Chien-Yu Lin. I also had the wonderful oppurtunities to collaborate with Prof. Diana Marculescu at UT Austin, which further strengthened my enthusiasm for tackling the inefficiency challenges in AI and ML applications, especially for LLM.
