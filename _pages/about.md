I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer System Laboratory](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, advised by Prof. [Mohamed S. Abdelfattah](https://www.mohsaied.com/). My research interests broadly encompass building machine learning systems and designing efficient algorithms for accelerating AI and ML applications. 

Before joining Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, where I worked with Prof. [Kai-Chiang Wu](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/members/detail/kcw?locale=en). 
During my senior year, I was fortunate to gain research experience as a remote intern under the guidance of Prof. [Luis Ceze](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/luisceze) at the University of Washington, mentored by [Chien-Yu Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~cyulin/). I also had the wonderful oppurtunities to collaborate with Prof. [Diana Marculescu](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dianam/) at UT Austin, which further strengthened my enthusiasm for tackling the inefficiency challenges in AI and ML applications, especially for LLM.
